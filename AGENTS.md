# AGENTS.md

Agent-maintained docs are for durable context only. Code is the source of
truth; docs route agents and preserve non-obvious project rationale.

## Guardrails

- Never commit directly to `main`; work on a branch and open a PR.
- Keep changes scoped; avoid incidental refactors.
- Verify behavior (`npm run build`, load the unpacked extension) before
  documenting claims.

## Read routing

- Read `context/MAP.md` before changing module layout, data flow, or which
  Screener sections/endpoints are scraped.
- Read `context/DECISIONS.md` before changing a recorded tradeoff (schedule
  API vs click simulation, doc-scraping scope, bundling approach).
- Read `context/CONVENTIONS.md` while writing or editing code.
- Run `todo list` at task start; `todo claim <id>` before editing
  orchestrated todos.

## Write triggers

- `context/MAP.md`: files/modules added, removed, moved, or data flow
  changed (e.g. a new Screener section/endpoint scraped).
- `context/DECISIONS.md`: only choices that pass the decision-log bar below.
- `context/CONVENTIONS.md`: new repeatable coding/testing rule.
- `README.md`: user-facing install/usage changed.

## Decision-log bar

`context/DECISIONS.md` is a curated ADR file, not a worklog. Append only
when a choice changes architecture, public behavior, data shape, dependency
ownership, or an expensive migration path **and** future agents need
non-obvious rationale to avoid re-litigating it.

Do not append decisions for bug fixes, cleanup, dead-code removal, renames,
mechanical refactors, one-feature implementation tactics, or routine
test/lint chores. Before appending, prefer amending or superseding an
existing decision. When in doubt, do not append; keep task-local rationale
in the todo, PR, commit message, or final response.

## What not to document

- Changelogs/worklogs; git already has history.
- Feature/status checklists duplicated from code/tests.
- Restatements of obvious code behavior.
- Decisions that fail the decision-log bar.

## CONVENTIONS vs DECISIONS

- `CONVENTIONS.md` contains terse imperative rules only.
- Rationale belongs in `DECISIONS.md` only if it passes the decision-log bar.

## Todos ↔ Decisions

Use todos as stateful task records, not scratch notes. Keep live working
context in the todo body. Before closing a todo, graduate durable rationale
to `context/DECISIONS.md` only if it passes the decision-log bar.

## Definition of Done

Code, tests/lint, and durable docs must agree. If a change passes the
decision-log bar, its rationale must be recorded before the task is done.
